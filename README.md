A webpage created with React and JS for the classic Game of life.

What is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game of life?</a>

A 0-player game, where you set the initial state for the cells, then observe your population bloom or die. 

RULES: 
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
